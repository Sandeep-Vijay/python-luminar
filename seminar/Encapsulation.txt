>>> Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is used to restrict access to methods and variables.
    In encapsulation, code and data are wrapped together within a single unit

    Eg:if an employee from the accounts section needs the records of sales from the sales section,
       then they cannot directly access it.
       To access, the employee of the account sections needs to get permission from the sales section team member.
       Therefore, the sales data is hidden from other departments
