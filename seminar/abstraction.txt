>>> Abstraction in python

   > Defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user.
   > Hide all the irrelevant data/process of an application in order to reduce complexity
   > In Python, abstraction can be achieved by using abstract classes and methods in our programs.
   > Python provides the abc module to use the abstraction in the Python program

>>  Eg:  while we shop on Amazon or other online shopping,we buy products/ add to cart and pay for them,
          But when we click on the available options which perform a lot of functionalities
          behind and that implementation is not available to the user.

>>> Abstract class and Methods

   > A class containing abstract methods is called abstract class called Abstract class.
   > Method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.
     A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod

>> It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any
   child classes built from the abstract class.
